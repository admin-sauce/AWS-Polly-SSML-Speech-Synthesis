# AWS Polly & SSML Speech Synthesis

This repository contains an example project for converting text into speech using **AWS Polly** and **SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)**. As part of my **#30DaysCloudChallenge**, I‚Äôve documented how to use SSML tags to customize the pronunciation, pacing, and emphasis of AWS Polly‚Äôs text-to-speech output.

## Overview

AWS Polly enables developers to add natural-sounding speech to applications. SSML takes this a step further by allowing fine control over the way Polly reads text, making it perfect for creating lifelike voices in applications.

## Features

- üì¢ Text-to-speech conversion using AWS Polly
- ‚ú® Enhanced control over speech output with SSML tags (e.g., emphasis, spelling, and number formatting)
- üõ†Ô∏è Script to easily implement and test SSML with AWS Polly

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** with access to the Polly service
- **AWS CLI** configured with credentials for Polly access
- **Python 3.x** with `boto3` library installed for using AWS SDK

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-polly-ssml-speech-synthesis.git
   cd aws-polly-ssml-speech-synthesis
